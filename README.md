# IR-query-expansion

## ABSTRACT
In this paper we are going to use the Word2vec word embedding technique. Word2vec detects synonymous words for incomplete sentences. We will test whether or not it is possible to improve the effectiveness of ad hoc search. By using TREC Robust 2004 data set, we will check the above hypothesis for results, while at the same time we will be looking for limitations and drawbacks for the selected strategy. We present results on recall, precision, cumulative gain(normalized and non) ,mean average precision and mean reciprocal rank. Our practical goal was to use query expansion to see if we can improve the results of the queries, while also testing a variety of different ways to form the query.
